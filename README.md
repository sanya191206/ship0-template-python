# Ship 0 — Python

**Two tracks in one repo:** a gentle **Baseline** to verify your setup, and an optional **Hard Mode** that asks you to build a tiny CLI with persistence and tests.

## Why you’re doing this

* To prove your computer can run modern Python (3.11) and packages.
* To learn **what** each command does — not just copy-paste incantations.
* To get comfortable with **virtual environments**, **pip**, **modules**, **JSON**, **tests**, and **Git**.

---

## Get the code

You’ll work directly from the shared repository. Don’t fork or template.
1. First either fork the repository or use the template of this repository to make your own copy.

2. Clone the forked/templated repository repo or use the built in "Clone a Github Repo" on a newly opened window.

3. Create a new branch named with your first and last name (lowercase, dash separated):

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <firstname-lastname>
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b weston-voglesonger
   ```

4. Verify your branch:

   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

---

## Working on your branch

As you make changes:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add -A

# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "Ship 0: baseline work"

# Push your branch to GitHub
git push -u origin <firstname-lastname>
```

All of your work for Ship 0 should be done **only** on your `<firstname-lastname>` branch. Do not commit to `main`.

## What is a virtual environment (venv), really?

A **virtual environment** is a self-contained folder that holds its own Python interpreter and installed packages. It keeps your project’s dependencies isolated from the rest of your machine so one project’s install doesn’t break another’s.

* Creating a venv: `python3 -m venv .venv` creates a `.venv/` folder in your repo.
* Activating it: `source .venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) or `.\.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
* Why activate? So `python` and `pip` point **inside** the venv. Confirm with `which python` (macOS/Linux) or `where python` (Windows).

When you’re done, deactivate with `deactivate` or just close the terminal. You can delete a venv by removing the `.venv/` folder and recreating it later.

---

## What is `pip`?

`pip` is Python’s package installer. It grabs packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

* Upgrade it inside your venv: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
* Install from a list: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

We use **NumPy** for a tiny stat calculation and **pytest** for tests.

---

## What does `python -m` do?

The `-m` flag runs a **module** by name (like `ship0`) instead of a file path. It tells Python to treat the current directory as a package, look up `ship0/__main__.py`, and execute it. This is how you’ll run your CLI in Hard Mode: `python -m ship0`.

---

## Baseline (Required) — Environment Check

You’ll run a small script that prints:

* your name,
* Python version,
* NumPy version,
* your 1-sentence semester goal read from `goals.txt`.

**Files you’ll touch**

* `env_check.py` — the script (already written)
* `goals.txt` — put your one-sentence goal on the **first line**
* `README.md` — paste your run output under **Run Output**

**Run it (read the comments in each step)**

```bash
# 1) Create a fresh virtual environment in this repo
python3 -m venv .venv                     # Windows: py -3.11 -m venv .venv

# 2) Activate it (this changes your PATH so 'python' points inside .venv)
source .venv/bin/activate                 # Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate

# 3) Upgrade pip and install the project requirements into THIS venv
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4) Edit the first line of goals.txt with your one-sentence goal
#    Then run the script:
python env_check.py
```

**Pass (Baseline) if all true**

* Script prints your **name**, **Python version**, **NumPy version**, and **goal**.
* Screenshot saved at `screenshots/run.png` **or** embedded in this README.
* **≥2 commits** with meaningful messages.
* Work lives on your `<firstname-lastname>` branch.

Paste your terminal output here:

```
Name: SANYA SAQIB
Python: 3.12.1
NumPy: 2.3.3
Goal: Build something small every week and demo it.

```

## Hard Mode (Optional, Scored) — CLI + Persistence + Tests

Build a tiny **Ship Log** command-line app. You’ll implement a few functions and wire them into a CLI.

**Commands (after implementation)**

* `python -m ship0 add "text"` — append a timestamped entry
* `python -m ship0 list` — print newest-first
* `python -m ship0 stats` — print **count** and **mean entry length** (uses NumPy)
* `python -m ship0 clear -y` — clear the log without a confirmation prompt

**Data**

* Stored at `data/log.json` (auto-created). Override with env var `SHIP0_DATA_PATH=/tmp/mylog.json`.

**Where to write code**

* `src/ship0/storage.py` — implement `load_entries`, `save_entries`, `add_entry`, `clear_entries`
* `src/ship0/stats.py` — implement `mean_length`
* `src/ship0/cli.py` — the `argparse` CLI is scaffolded for you; minimal edits may be needed

**Tests**

* Run: `pytest -q` (inside your venv). Two tests are provided.
* You pass if both tests are **green** and the CLI behaves as specified.

**Opt-in CI for Hard Mode**

* Create an empty file named `HARDMODE` (no extension) in the repo root **when you’re ready**. Our GitHub Action will detect it and run `pytest`. No `HARDMODE` file = light checks only (baseline students won’t see a scary red X).

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Windows execution policy**: if activation fails, run PowerShell as Admin once:

  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```

  Then reactivate: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
* **“pip not found”** inside venv: use `python -m pip ...`
* **NumPy build errors on Linux**: `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`
* **pytest can’t import ship0**: ensure you’re running tests from the repo root and your venv is active.

---

## What to submit

* Repo URL
* Screenshot
* Track (Baseline only **or** Hard Mode)
* Minutes spent + biggest blocker

Do you want me to also **rewrite the README file for the repo itself** in this style so it’s copy-paste ready for GitHub?
